Capstone Project: Super Tic-Tac-Toe

	-This project will use React/Node as its tech stack
	-This project will be heavily focused on the front-end UI.
	-This is intended to be a website, but I will attempt to make it adaptable to phone screen layouts
	-There is no specific intended audience
  -I will be creating my own API
  -I will first create tic-tac-toe, just as a base to work off of, before moving on to implement that nine times over. Users should be encountering a start screen where they may start a new game or login to see any potential records of wins and losses. I am unsure about adding a computer based opponent as it seems to be a very complicated endeavor. Perhaps that can be a stretch goal for the future.
