Capstone Project: Super Tic-Tac-Toe

-This project will use React/Node as its tech stack
-This project will be heavily focused on the front-end UI.
-This is intended to be a website, but I will attempt to make it adaptable to phone screen layouts
-There is no specific intended audience
-I will be creating my own API
-The users will start on a main screen
    -They can either start a new game
    -They can login to see their win/loss ratio
