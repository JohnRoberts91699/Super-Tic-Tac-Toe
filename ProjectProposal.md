Capstone Project: Super Tic-Tac-Toe

-This project will use React/Node as its tech stack
-This project will be heavily focused on the front-end UI.
-This is intended to be a website, but I will attempt to make it adaptable to phone screen layouts
-There is no specific intended audience
-I will be creating my own API
-The users will start on a main screen
    -There will be a button to start a new game
        -Clicking the button will take users to the game screen where they will make their first move as X
    -There will be a form to input login credentials
        -inputting login credentials will reload the page, remove the login form, and display the win/loss record associated with that user
