                <p>Super Tic-Tac-Toe is an advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe played on a 9x9 grid.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 9x9 grid is divided into nine 3x3 grids, known as mini-boards.</li>
                    <li>The first player (X) starts by playing in any of the 81 spots.</li>
                    <li>The location of the move within a mini-board determines where the next player (O) must play. For example, if X plays in the top-left corner of the top-left mini-board, O must play in the top-left mini-board.</li>
                    <li>If a mini-board is already won or full, the player can choose any other mini-board.</li>
                    <li>Players win a mini-board by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
                    <li>The game is won by the player who wins three mini-boards in a row on the larger 3x3 grid.</li>
                    <li>The game ends in a draw if all mini-boards are full and no player has won the larger grid.</li>
